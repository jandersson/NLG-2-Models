The Simple Good-Turing smoothing technique is a discounting algorithm, slightly more complex than Laplace smoothing \cite{Jurafsky2000}. The Simple-Good Turing Smoothing technique is not used in practice, rather it is used as an intermediate step in more advanced smoothing algorithms \cite{chen-smoothing}. In practice, this technique uses the frequency of singletons (N-grams with a single occurrence) to re-estimate the probability count of the missing mass (zero count N-grams). Simple Good-Turing Smoothing differs from Good-Turing Smoothing in that for each missing mass, the bin size is computed, and then smoothed before calculated the adjusted count to fill in any zeros in the sequence \cite{Jurafsky2000}. Despite claims made in \citep{chen-smoothing}, we felt it would be instructive to let the algorithm stand on its own and examine the results.
