In this section we present the results of our experiments. We present the performance of the algorithms tested and which of the techniques used performed best. We show the ngram count affects the sentences generated and what affect smoothing could have on a sentence generation.

We present that using

\subsection{nGram count}
When testing different values for N in the n-gram models it was clear that the quad-gram models was generating exceptionally good sentences. But when examined it was  generating sentences straight out of the corpus. The probability of three words, the key in the quad-gram model, appearing together in the corpus was low so that the corpus would just get regenerated. Using a large corpus is probably best fit for quad grams. Using a tri-gram model generated sentences that would best resemble a human writing. We had problems though that sentences generated could change from past tense to present tense and gender words could like "she" would refer to a man. Bi-grams generated sentences that were grammatically correct up to the point were it would never have two consecutive words that are not grammatically correct in English grammar. But the sentences generated by the bi-gram model would not be grammatically good in general and perform poorly.
